	Show Up & Do The Work: Consistency Outperforms Talent

  I used to believe ability was everything. If I practice and improve, success is guaranteed, right? I was wrong. Ability doesn't matter if you don't do the work.

## Consistency is the deciding factor in long-term success

In fact, I'd argue that if you could only choose one, consistency without ability would perform better than the opposite. **Continuing to show up will overcome nearly any other shortcoming and allow you to get where you want to go.**

## It's not what you're capable of â€” it's what you do that counts

A relatively small group of people produce most of what we experience every day, from entertainment to education to products to businesses. And you might look at that output and feel strongly that you could do a better job. And, hey! You're probably right!

But here's the thing: the creator you're critiquing is showing up and doing the work and they're achieving their goals. It doesn't matter how much talent or potential you have â€”Â if you're not showing up and doing the work, you won't see much progress.

**A mediocre-but-consistent effort will outperform an excellent-but-infrequent effort just about every time.**

## Steady, incremental process adds up in a big way

It's easy to hold back from putting something out because it doesn't feel big enough to matter.

We delay shipping to add more or rework concepts. We wait for inspiration to strike. And as the gap between releases gets bigger and bigger, we feel more and more pressure to make the next thing we put out big enough to justify the longer wait â€” a losing game.

Instead of focusing our energy on huge, standalone efforts, we can see a lot more cumulative progress by focusing on what James Clear calls [the power of tiny gains](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement).

{% endfigure %}

Stacking up steady, incremental progress has a compounding effect. **1% every day may not sound like much, but the cumulative effect is exponential growth over longer periods of time.**

(And, to be clear, "longer periods" isn't actually all that long. A year happens fast.)

## Show up, do the work, and don't forget to keep learning

A less obvious benefit of consistency is that you get lots of reps and lots of feedback.

Deliberate practice â€” e.g. putting in lots of reps on the thing you want to improve at â€” is a proven way to build world-class skills.

Getting real feedback from the audience you're trying to reach is also proven to improve the quality of your work.

**By focusing on consistently putting things out there, you have significantly more opportunities to try something, learn from its reception, adjust your approach, and try again.**

But remember to both learn and adjust â€”Â without the effort to gather feedback and act on it, you'll benefit from consistency, but won't see the full potential of your growth.

## The best time to start is now

If you haven't built a consistent practice of getting your work out into the world, the best time to start is now.

What's a manageable scope that you can commit to on a regular cadence? Aim for something that almost feels too easy. 80% of what you think you could pull off is a good target, because it's important that you can still do it when you're stressed, tired, and less excited about doing it.

**We can all stay consistent when we're in a great mood and feeling motivated. What really makes the difference is finding a way to stay consistent when we feel like shit and would rather stay in bed.**

Choose a goal. Build the habit. Build momentum. Do the work. Make it sustainable. Be patient. It'll happen. ðŸ’œ
